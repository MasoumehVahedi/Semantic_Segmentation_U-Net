# Semantic Segmentation
This project comes from Kaggle Competitons called Semantic Segmentation for Self Driving Cars. In this project, to solve the semantic segmentation problem, there has implemented a deep learning model through Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) called UNET. The architectures of these are briefly introduced in the following.
